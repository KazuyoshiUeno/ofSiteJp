code::blocks setup guide
=========================


We like codeblocks for windows development since it's light weight, and avoids some of the quirkiness of windows visual studio. here's a step by step tutorial to get up and running.

**a) download code::blocks binary (latest release)**

[Download Code::Blocks][0] note: download WITH mingw.   The latest version 10.05, works well.

**b) install**

**c) you don't have to change anything**

**d) I chose not too, since code::blocks is not my primary IDE**

**e) add files to mingw**


similar to devcpp, we will have to add a few libraries to devcpp. you can download the files :

> [additions for codeblocks to work with OF][1]


in the zip there are two folders, you need to put the **contents** of them into the contents of folders in mingw.

*   add the _contents_ of the folder "**add\_to\_codeblocks\_mingw\_include**" into "**C:\\Program Files\\CodeBlocks\\MinGW\\include**" (or wherever your app\\mingw\\include is)
*   add the _contents_ of the folder "**add\_to\_codeblocks\_mingw\_lib**" into "**C:\\Program Files\\CodeBlocks\\MinGW\\lib**" (or wherever your app\\mingw\\lib is)

These are additional libs and header files that need to be added to the MinGW distribution that comes with codeblocks. 

here's a quick video which shows what this should look like:  [copying codeblocks](http://vimeo.com/33985058)

note: if you have already installed dev-c++, make sure that CB picks the right mingw folder (c:/program files/cb/mingw), it has a tendancy to default to c:/mingw, where devc++ installs... [more info on this][2]

**As always have fun!**
