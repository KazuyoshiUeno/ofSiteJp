  <h2>Your First Look inside oF</h2>
<p>今このページを閲覧している方々は、http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/ にてopenFrameworksアーカイブファイルをダウンロードし終わり、この適切なセットアップガイドのページにたどり着いているのかと思います。</p>
<p>まず最初にダウンロードしたopenFrameworksのアーカイブファイルを解凍し、解凍後に出来たフォルダを、簡単にアクセス出来る場所に配置する事から行いましょう。　個人的には、下記の様に書類フォルダに配置し、そのショートカットをサイドバーに作成する事が好きです。</p>
<p><img alt="Shortcut" src="images/shortcut.png" /></p>
<p>配置場所に関係なく、フォルダを開くと基本的に下記に示す様なフォルダ構成を見る事が出来るはずです。</p>
<p><img alt="addons, apps, and libs folders" src="images/structure1.png" /></p>
<p>では、これらのフォルダはどんなものなのでしょう？</p>
<h4>addons</h4>
<p>openFrameworks "core"は、最も重要な機能のみを含んでいます。addonsフォルダに追加されるものは、断片的な機能を持ったアプリケーションになります。例えば、XMLファイルを解析するようなものであったり、3Dモデルデータをロードしたり、openCVライブラリを利用したものであったりします。</p>
<h4>apps</h4>
<p>このフォルダが、あなたが作るアプリケーションを配置する場所となります。作業時間のほとんどを費やす場所でもありますね。既に２つのフォルダ… appsフォルダとaddonExamplesフォルダが存在していると思います。</p>
<h4>libs</h4>
<p>oF coreと同レベルでopenFrameworksが使用する全てのライブラリがこのフォルダに含まれています。</p>
<p><strong>注意</strong>：このドキュメントを読んでいれば、CodeForArtフォルダもaddons, apps, libsフォルダと同階層に持つ事になるでしょう。</p>
<h2>サンプルプログラムを試してみよう</h2>
<p>appsフォルダにはexamplesフォルダとaddonsExamplesフォルダの２つのサブフォルダが存在します。両フォルダ内には、openFrameworksが出来る事を説明している、いくつかのopenFrameworksプロジェクトが入っています。まず、アプリケーション開発に入る前に、これら全てのサンプルアプリケーションを動かしてみる事が、よい試みとなるでしょう。ただし使用しているIDEによって、若干動作させる方法が違います。</p>
<h3>XCode</h3>
<p>apps/examples/graphicsExampleフォルダを開き、"graphicsExample.xcodeproj"ファイルをダブルクリックしましょう。</p>
<p><img alt="navigate to graphicsExample" src="images/graphicsExample01.png" /></p>
<p>この様なウィンドウが表示されます。</p>
<p><img alt="graphicsExample 02" src="images/graphicsExample02.png" /></p>
<p><strong>重要：</strong>XCodeのバージョンが何か確認してください。メニューバーから、XCode &gt; About XCodeで確認できます。もし4.0より小さいバージョンですとwindowの見た目がかなり違うと思いますが、慌てる必要はありません。 インターフェース上、対応する機能は、簡単に見つけられるはずです。</p>
<p>大きな"Run"ボタンが左上にあります。XCode3系をお使いの方ですと、"Build &amp; Run"ボタンです。 このボタンを押すと現在選択しているアーカイブターゲットが実行されます。しかし、デフォルトではアクティブターゲットが"openFrameworks"となっていると思います。このまま"Run"ボタンを押しても何も行われません。　今、実行したいプログラムは"graphicsExample"なので、もし以下の様に"openFrameworks"が選択されていたら、</p>
<p><img alt="openFrameworks library chosen" src="images/target-bad.png" /></p>
<p>"openFrameworks"の部分をクリックして"graphicsExample"を選択しましょう。下記の様になると思います。</p>
<p><img alt="graphicsExample target chosen" src="images/target-good.png" /></p>
<p>では、"Run"ボタンをクリックしましょう！この様に表示されるはずです。</p>
<p><img alt="graphicsExample, running" src="images/graphicsExample03.png" /></p>
<p>エスケープキー　もしくは、Apple+Qでプログラムが終了します。</p>
<p><strong>注意：トラブルシューティング</strong></p>
<p>もしエラーが発生したら、"Base SDK"の設定を10.6にしましょう。</p>
<ul>
<li>左端にある"graphicsExample"をクリック</li>
<li>“Build Settings”をクリック　- 下記参照</li>
<li>"All"と"Combined"を選択しておきましょう。</li>
<li><em>Base SDK</em> を選択して、10.6に設定しましょう。</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="10.6 Fix" src="images/tenpointsix.png" /></p>
<h5>プロジェクト毎にこの設定を行う可能性があるので、慣れておく事をお勧めします。</h5>
<p>では、全てのサンプルプログラムを試してみましょう。</p>
<h3>Code::Blocks</h3>
<p>coming soon!</p>
<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>coming soon!</p>
<h2>初めてのプロジェクト作成</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, openFrameworks takes care of most of the tedious work of setting up a c++ project in your IDE of choice. However, unlike programs like Flash or Processing, there is no "File &gt; New" that allows you to create a project. Instead, the preferred method is to duplicate one of the example projects. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT: By extension, this means that you should never edit any of the example projects or put your own apps into the examples folders. They are placed there to provide starting points for your own apps, but you'll want to keep them pristene so that you always have a working starting point for your projects. You'll see the importance of this more as you move forward.</p>
<p>As simple as this seems, this can be a huge stumbling block for a lot of beginners, so first lets agree on some terminology. </p>
<p>When you open your apps folder, you see 2 folders: <em>examples</em> and <em>addonsExamples</em>. Let's call these folders <em>workspaces</em>.</p>
<p>If you open one of those workspaces, you see more folders, like <em>easyCamExample</em>, <em>floatingPointImageExample</em>, <em>movieGrabberExample</em>, and <em>serialExample</em>. Each one of those folders is a <em>project</em>. Each contains (among other things) an ".xcodeproj" file and a "src" folder. A <em>project</em> <em>must</em> be inside a <em>workspace</em> and can be compiled into a single application.</p>
<p><img alt="Workspace terminology" src="images/workspace04.png" /></p>
<p>We want to create a <em>project</em>, but every project has to live inside a <em>workspace</em>, and we're not supposed to put anything into the <em>examples</em> and <em>addonsExamples</em> workspaces, so our first step is going to be to make a new <em>workspace</em> by simply creating a folder called "MyFirstWorkspace" in the apps folder. You will probably end up making many workspaces while using openFrameworks. You can use them however you want, but the important thing is that they are directly inside the "apps" folder, ie: you can't have a workspace inside another workspace. </p>
<p><img alt="&quot;My First Workspace&quot;" src="images/workspace01.png" /></p>
<p>Next we will [underline]#copy# (NOT move) the entire "emptyExample" folder from the "examples" workspace and paste it into "MyFirstWorkspace". On a mac, you can literally click on the emptyExample folder, press apple+C, then navigate to the "MyFirstWorkspace" folder and press apple+V. So the result should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="My First Project" src="images/workspace02.png" /></p>
<p>Next, we can rename the duplicate project folder from "emptyExample" to "MyFirstProject". </p>
<p><img alt="My First Project" src="images/workspace03.png" /></p>
<p>The super important thing here is that your XCode Project file is <em>exactly</em> 3 folders "below" the Root Folder (refer to colorful diagram above). So, whenever you make a new project, or if you are suddenly getting thousands of errors for no apparent reason, you should always double check that your XCode Project file is in the correct place.</p>
<p>The reason for this has to do with the 'lib' folder. We previously mentioned that openFrameworks is a "glue" for a bunch of different libraries, and these libraries are located in the 'lib' directory. We also discovered that it is the the job of the IDE know how to find and link together the various libraries. So, when the IDE tries to compile your program, it is set up to look for libraries in "../../../lib", or, in other words: "go back three folders (http://support.dtsearch.com/webhelp/dtsearch/relative_paths.htm[relative] to your .xcodeproj) and then look for a lib directory."  For instance, if you dig deep into the settings of any openFrameworks project, you will find paths like "../../../libs/FreeImage/include" and "../../../libs/poco/include". So, as long as your .xcodeproj file is within of_preRelease_v007_osx/apps/[workspace]/[project], everything will compile. If not, things will get ugly.</p>
<p>Okay!  Now you have created your first very own openFrameworks project. Double click on the XCode Project file in your new "MyFirstProject" and make sure "emptyExample" is selected as the target and click "Run" and you should see:</p>
<p>image:images/PlainGray.png["Plain Gray Window",width="600"]</p>
<p>Nothing! But that's exactly what you should see. Well, it's not too exciting yet, but you are well on your way.</p>
<p>Press escape or Apple+Q to exit out of the program.</p>
<h3>Renaming your Project in XCode</h3>
<p>You might be tempted to also rename "emptyExample.xcodeproj" to "MyFirstProject.xcodeproj", and if you are using XCode &lt; 4, you can. But as of XCode 4, this seems to cause some problems. So, instead, open up your project in XCode and click on the "emptyExample" title in the upper left as shown here:</p>
<p><img alt="Renaming your Project" src="images/rename01.png" /></p>
<p>After you rename it, you will get a dialog box asking you if you'd like to rename a bunch of other stuff. Click "Rename"</p>
<p><img alt="Renaming your Project" src="images/rename02.png" /></p>
<h3>voila!</h3>
<p>When you click "Run" from within XCode, what actually happens behind the scenes is that your code is compiled into an executable and placed within the "bin" directory. Then that application is run just as if you had double clicked it. So, if you look in "MyFirstWorkspace/MyFirstApplication/bin" folder, you should see an application icon. This is your application! If you double-click on it, you will see the same gray window. Now you can send this application to all of your friends (who use a Mac) and they can launch your wonderful gray window program.</p>
<p><img alt="Your Executable" src="images/workspace05.png" /></p>
<h2>Writing Code</h2>
<p>Okay, now that you know how to create a project, it's time to start writing some code inside it. The next few sections will introduce you to the structure of an openFrameworks application and a few simple drawing and setup functions.</p>
<h3>testApp.cpp</h3>
<p>So it's finally time to start looking at some code. The first thing you need to do is open up a project in XCode. I'm going to assume that we are working with "MyFirstProject" inside the workspace "MyFirstWorkspace" from the last section. When you first open it up, take a look in the <em>Navigator View</em> (the panel on the far left of XCode) and click the disclosure triangle like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Open up the project" src="images/expand01.gif" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the disclosure triangle next to "MyFirstProject"</li>
<li>Click the disclosure triangle next to "src"</li>
<li>Click on testApp.cpp</li>
</ul>
<p>testApp.cpp is going to become your very good friend over the next few tutorials. In the <em>Editor Window</em>, you should see something that starts like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">#include &quot;testApp.h&quot;

//--------------------------------------------------------------
void testApp::setup(){

}

//--------------------------------------------------------------
void testApp::update(){

}

//--------------------------------------------------------------
void testApp::draw(){

}

//--------------------------------------------------------------
void testApp::keyPressed(int key){

}
</code></pre>

<p>So what is going on here?</p>
<p>In a lot of ways, testApp.cpp is like hello.cpp, the file that we wrote in the Introduction. It's a plain text file that contains <code>c++</code> source code. The difference now is that we are editing it through our IDE, so there is some really nice syntax highlighting that will hopefully make it easier to make sense of the code, and it will be a lot easier to compile and run when we want to.</p>
<p>On a very basic level, what you see here is a bunch of empty functions. A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_science)[function] is a set of instructions that make up part of a larger program. Just in the snippet of code above, there are 4 functions: setup, update, draw, and keyPressed. Each of the functions is followed by a set of curly brackets ({}). What usually goes inside of these curly brackets are the instructions (assiging values to variables, loops, and calls to other functions) that make up the functions. </p>
<p>If you refer back to the Q&amp;A "What is a software framework?" in the introduction, the film production company analogy is particularly useful at this point. What you are looking at in testApp.cpp is how openFrameworks has provided all of the infrastructure and logistical details. Now it's your job to define what happens. You do this by putting code into the fuctions in testApp.cpp</p>
<p>These functions will be called by openFrameworks at different points during the execution of your program. Let's take a look at a few of them.</p>
<h4>setup</h4>
<p>This function is called (ie: any code that you've put inside the curly brackets runs) at the very beginning of the life of your application, before your program window opens. So, let's say, for instance, you wanted to set the size of the window. You probably want this to happen before the window actually opens, so setup would be a good place for that.</p>
<h4>update, draw</h4>
<p>After the setup function runs, the update and draw functions begin a loop that continues until your program ends. So, after setup() runs, update() runs, then draw(), then update(), then draw(), etc. and by default, this happens as fast as your computer can handle. update() is typically used for updating the state of your program (ie: changing the value of variables), while draw() is used to actually draw things into your window.</p>
<h4>keyPressed, keyReleased, mouseMoved, mouseDragged, mousePressed</h4>
<p>Unlike the previous three functions, these functions are called only when a user does something. Can you guess what?</p>
<p>But enough with the reading. Let's see these things in action.</p>
<h3>Making a Mark</h3>
<p>We will start by drawing a simple circle in our gray window using the ofCircle function. Type <code>ofCircle(200, 200, 60);</code> on the blank line inside the draw() function so that your draw function looke like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    ofCircle(200, 300, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Notice the semicolon at the end of the line. All function calls must end with a semicolon. In addition, function names are always case sensitive, so OfSetColor will not work, nor OFsetcolor, etc. only ofSetColor.</p>
<p>Now run your program. You should see something like:</p>
<p><img alt="A Plain White Circle" src="images/MyFirstProject01.png" /></p>
<p>Congratulations!  You just made something appear on the screen! It's all downhill from here.</p>
<p>But what did we just do? </p>
<p><a href="http://openframeworks.jp/documentation/graphics/ofGraphics.html#ofCircle">ofCircle</a> is a function that comes with openFrameworks (hence the 'of' prefix). You can invoke the ofCircle function inside your draw function as many times as you'd like. The numbers inside of the parenthesis after 'ofCircle' are called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)[arguments]. They determine exactly what the function does. They answer the questions: "okay, you want to draw a circle, but where? and how big?" Functions can take any number of arguments, always separated by commas, but ofCircle takes 3: an x coordinate, a y coordinate, and a radius. There are a few things you need to know to make sense of these arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>All measurements in openFrameworks are in pixels. By saying that our circle has a radius of 60, that means that it will take up PI*60^2^ pixels total.</li>
<li>This may seem obvious, but the coordinates refer to the center of the circle. Other shapes (such as rectangles) use the upper left corner.</li>
<li>The "origin" of the coordinate system is in the upper left of the window. So, our circle appears 200 pixels from the left side of the screen, and 300 pixels from the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: The order of the arguments is important. The first argument to ofCircle will always mean "x coordinate" and the third will always mean "radius". </p>
<p>NOTE: There are some functions (such as http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofGraphics.html#ofFill[ofFill], which simply tells oF to fill shapes that are drawn) that have 0 arguments, but you still have to put parenthesis after them. </p>
<p>If you hadn't just read about it here, you could have found information about ofCircle on the http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/[openFrameworks documentation page], which you will be using more as we move on.</p>
<h3>Adding some Color</h3>
<p>Your circle is great, but kind of boring. What if we want to introduce some color to our application? To do that, we need the the http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofGraphics.html#ofSetColor[ofSetColor] function. Try adding <code>ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);</code> right above the ofCircle line, so that your draw function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(200, 300, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now try running your application. </p>
<p>image:images/MyFirstProject02.png["A purple circle", width="500"]</p>
<p>Similar to ofCircle, the ofSetColor function takes 3 arguments, but the numbers have very different meanings. If you look at the documentation for http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofGraphics.html#ofSetColor[ofSetColor], you'll notice that they arguments actually represent the red, green, and blue values for the color that you want to use, on a scale of 0-255. So when we typed <code>ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);</code>, we were saying "until further notice, draw everything with 100% red, 0 green, and 100% blue."<br />
</p>
<p>TIP: Try changing the values to get different color variations.</p>
<p>This last point is important: when we call "ofSetColor", it's like picking a crayon out of a box. Everything that gets drawn after that (below that line of code) will be drawn in that color until we call ofSetColor again. So if we want to draw another circle on the screen, we could simply call the ofCircle function again:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(200, 300, 60);

    ofCircle(500, 500, 100);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But if we wanted that circle to be a different color, we would have to call ofSetColor again:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(200, 300, 60);

    ofSetColor(0, 255, 255);
    ofCircle(500, 500, 100);
}
</code></pre>

<p>All The Shapes You Can Handle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Of course, oF can draw more than circles. </p>
<p>. http://www.openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/ofGraphics.html#ofRect[ofRect] draws a rectangle. arguments are (x, y, width, height)

<p>NOTE: Control points can be tricky. If you've used the pen tool in photoshop or illustrator, you probably understand them. If not, check out http://www.actionscript.org/resources/articles/172/1/Understanding-curves-and-control-point-placement/Page1.html[this tutorial]. It's about ActionScript, but it gives a great overiew of the concept of curves and control points.</p>
<p>TIP:  Try making 3 different projects in your "MyFirstWorkspace" workspace. In each one, draw a different shape in a different location using a different color.</p>
<p>Adding Movement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Drawing static shapes is great, but what if we want our shapes to move around the screen?</p>
<p>We mentioned earlier that the draw() function is called repeatedly after the program is started. This is very important because it is how we achieve animation in openFrameworks. It might be a little unintuitive if you are used to  Flash or even something like stop-frame animation, where you can add something to a "stage" and then reposition it as needed. This is <em>not</em> how openFrameworks (or most computer animation) works. Actually, openFrameworks is more like traditional (we're talking old-school Disney/Bambi) animation, where we must redraw the frame completely every single "frame". In the parlance of openFrameworks, every time the draw() function is called is one "frame". So, in actuality, when you run the program above and see your purple circle, what you are actually looking at is the circle being drawn, then cleared (a single frame), and then drawn, then cleared, repeatedly. It's just happening so fast that it appears to stay where it is.</p>
<p>In the example above, when we draw our circle, we use two numbers to tell the ofCircle function where to draw the circle within the window. So it follows that, if we want the circle to appear to move, we need to change these numbers over time. Perhaps the first time draw() happens, the circle is drawn at (200, 300), but in the next time, we want it to be one pixel to the right (201, 300), and then another pixel to the right (202, 300), and so on. </p>
<p>In <code>c++</code>, and in programming in general, whenever you have a value that you want to change, you create a "variable". Variables come in different shapes and sizes depending on what they represent, such as decimal numbers, whole numbers, a letter, or a bunch of letters. In this case, we want to create variables that can stand in for coordinates in our ofCircle function, so we will use 2 <em>int</em>s.</p>
<p>Put this at the top of your testApp.cpp, right under the <code>#include</code> line, so that your file starts like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">#include &quot;testApp.h&quot;

int myCircleX;
int myCircleY;
</code></pre>

<p>In those 2 new lines of code, we "declared" 2 new variables: one called 'myCircleX' and one called 'myCircleY'. You could actually name them whatever you want (within reason), but it's a good idea to name them something that is related to how they will be used. We also said that these variables will be used to hold whole-number integer values, or <em>int</em>s. Declaring a variable is an important and necessary step. It's like telling your application "okay, I'm going to need to store a number that might change."</p>
<p>The next thing we need to do is give those variables a starting value. We know that the endgame here is to have these variables change over time. But before we can change them, we need to give them an initial value. In other words, before our circle starts moving, where will it appear? </p>
<p>In a previous section, we learned that the setup() function gets called once when the application launches, and then never called again. This sounds like it could be useful for giving our variables some initial values. So in your setup() function, add the following lines.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::setup(){
    myCircleX = 300;
    myCircleY = 200;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Perfect!  So, to recap, we now have 2 variables, 'myCircleX', and 'myCircleY', and we have just "initialized" them, or populated with an "initial" value. Notice that, just like any mathmatical equation, we use the equals sign (=) to assign the number 300 to 'myCircleX'. In <code>c++</code> parlance, the equals sign is known as the "assignment operator", because it's used to assign a value to a variable. The "assignment" always flows from right to left; that is, the value that is being assigned is on the right and thing that is receiving the assignment is on the left.</p>
<p>Now we can edit our ofCircle call a bit :</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(myCircleX, myCircleY, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we are still passing 3 arguments to the ofCircle function. But now, instead of the old "hard-coded" (200, 300) values that we can't change, we are letting the variables that we made stand in.</p>
<p>If you run your app now, you shouldn't notice any change. That's because we haven't gotten around to changing the variables yet. So let's do it.</p>
<p>Let's edit our draw function a little so that it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::draw(){
    myCircleX = myCircleX + 1;

    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(myCircleX, myCircleY, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this new line, we are using the "assignment operator" again, just like in the setup function. In English, that line would say "take the value of myCircleX plus one, and assign that to myCircleX". In other words, we are incrementing myCircleX by 1. <code>c++</code> provides a shortcut for the common task of incrementing a variable: <code>myCircleX++;</code>  This is extremely common, so let's actually change our code to use this handy shortcut:</p>
<p>....
myCircleX = myCircleX + 1;
....
becomes
....
myCircleX++;
....</p>
<p>If you run your program now, you should see your circle move off the screen to the right!  Animation!</p>
<p>There is just one thing we need to fix before moving on to more pressing aesthetic concerns. If you read back through the descriptions of what the update() and draw() functions are supposed to be used for, you'll notice that the draw function is for drawing (so far, so good), but the update() function is where we are supposed to take care of updating variables. There are some very good reasons for this that we will get into later, but for now, let's move the line we just wrote to the update function. So, your update and draw functions should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::update(){
    myCircleX++;
}

void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(myCircleX, myCircleY, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You shouldn't notice any difference in terms of functionality, but it's a good habit to get into.</p>
<p>Framerate</p>
<p>One thing you may notice about your awesome moving circle is that it starts off kind of slow and then speeds away. This is actually caused by the framerate of your application, which is slow at first while the application fires up, but then gets super fast. As mentioned before, framerate refers to the rate at which the draw/update loop executes. Add this little line of code to the bottom of your draw() function to be able to see your framerate in the upper left corner of your window:</p>
<p>....
ofDrawBitmapString(ofToString(ofGetFrameRate())+"fps", 10, 15);
....</p>
<p>Most likely, it says something very close to 1000fps. That means that your circle is being drawn close to one thousand times per second. If you were to fire up tons of other applications on your computer and start rendering a huge video in FinalCut, you'd notice this framerate drop. The fact is that your application is simply trying to run as fast as it possibly can.</p>
<p>In the interest of having a smoother, more predictable kind of animation, we will lower the framerate to something more reasonable, like 60. In order to do this, we will put a new line into our setup() function.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::setup(){
    ofSetFrameRate(60);

    myCircleX = 300;
    myCircleY = 200;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Add that and then run your program. You will notice that the circle moves considerably slower. Using this function is <em>not</em> a guarantee of 60 frames per second, but it is a guarantee that your framerate will be any higher than that. And unless you have a really old computer, or your processor is already extremely taxed by some other program, it should have no problem running consistently at 60fps while doing something a simple as drawing a moving circle.</p>
<p>TIP: SAT word problem #1: If we know that the update loop is happening (at most) 60 times/second, and we are incrementing the x coordinate of the circle by 1 pixel every time update is called, how long will it take for the circle to move 240px?</p>
<p>[TIP]
.Too bloody slow
=====================================================================
It's true that we now have a good handle on the framerate, but 60px/second turns out to be really slow. To fix this problem, we <em>could</em> increase the framerate, but 60fps is a pretty good framerate. so instead, let's change the speed of the circle itself:  instead of just incrementing the x coordinate by 1 pixel every time, let's increment it by 4. Using the same "incrementing" shortcut, we can change our update() function like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::update(){
    myCircleX+=4;
}
</code></pre>

<p>=====================================================================</p>
<p>The Pacman Effect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Let's have one final adventure with our purple circle before saying goodbye. Our application is still a litlte dissapointing because once our circle leaves the screen on the right, it's gone forever. Let's fix that problem by making the circle re-appear on the left side after leaving on the right: the Pacman Effect.</p>
<p>Before we write any code, let's think about what this is going to mean in terms of the variables that we have. In the current state, we have myCircleX acting as the x coordinate for our circle, and it is being incrementing by 1 (or 4, if you followed the tip above) every frame. By default, an openFrameworks window is 1024x768. So, one way we could achieve the Pacman Effect is to reset myCircleX back to 300 once it goes beyond 1024. </p>
<p>How can we do this? We know that we are supposed to do any variable updating in the update() function, so let's start there. We also know that we <em>only</em> want to reset myCircleX <em>if</em> it has gone above 1024. So for that, we use the 'if' statement.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::update(){
    myCircleX++;        
    if(myCircleX &gt; 1024) 
    {
        myCircleX = 300;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code says:</p>
<ul>
<li>increment myCircleX by one. </li>
<li>test if myCircleX is greater than 1024</li>
<li><em>only</em> if that test turns out to be true, set myCircleX back to 300;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Interaction</h2>
<p>Now that you are a master of animation, it's time to get the user involved. For this section, we will be focusing on keyboard and mouse interaction. </p>
<p>So far, we've been focusing on 3 functions: setup(), update(), and draw(). For interaction, we will start with 2 of the other functions in your testApp.cpp file:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::keyPressed(int key){

}

void testApp::keyReleased(int key){

}
</code></pre>

<p>Going back to the producer metaphor can help us understand how these functions work. openFrameworks has done the hard work of setting up your app to know when the user has done some keyboard business. Now, all you have to do is put code into these functions that you want to execute when a particular event occurs: </p>
<ul>
<li>user physically presses down on a key</li>
<li>user physically releases the key</li>
</ul>
<p>This might be a little unintuitive if you are accustomed to thinking about typing a letter as a single action: "I just typed the letter 'o'". But in fact, they are 2 distinct actions, or "events", and eventually you might find it handy to be able to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>Create a new project in "MyFirstWorkspace" called "KeyboardInteraction". If you need to, go back to "Creating your First Project" to see how.</p>
<p>image:images/KeyboardInteraction01.png["Keyboard Interaction Project"]</p>
<p>Introducing, cout!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The easiest way to quickly see how these functions work is to print a message to the console. Remember when we printed "Hello, World!" to the console in the introduction? We did that using a <code>c++</code> thing called http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/cout/["cout"] (pronounced 'c out'). The syntax for using it is a bit weird because it's not technically a function (it's actually an object, which we will talk more about in later chapters), but if you can get beyond the syntax, it's actually very useful for debugging. </p>
<p>But first: you may be asking yourself: how will we see text output? We are dealing with a GUI interface now. Luckily, XCode provdes a window where we can see anything text that your program outputs (also known as http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/stdout/[stdout]).</p>
<p>So start by going to View-&gt;Debug Area-&gt;Activate Console, or press apple+shift+C</p>
<p>image:images/activate-console.png["Activate Console"]</p>
<p>NOTE: For XCode 3 users, use the key command Shift-Cmd-R. There's also a preference in XCode to bring up the console after each launch - Xcode-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Debugging-&gt;On Start Show Console.</p>
<p>You should see a panel like this appear at the bottom of your XCode window</p>
<p>image:images/debug-area.png["Debug Area"]</p>
<p>Excellent! Your output will appear in the pane on the right. Now we will add some code to our key functions that will print stuff to the console:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::keyPressed(int key){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;keyPressed &quot; &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void testApp::keyReleased(int key){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;keyReleased &quot; &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned before, the syntax for cout is a little strange and, frankly, way beyond the scope of this chapter. In <code>c++</code> parlance, cout represents the "standard output stream", and without worrying too much about what that means, "stream" is a nice way to think about it. If you look at the line of code within 'keyPressed', it appears that there is a "stream" of data flowing into the "cout". First we send in the string "keyPressed " down the stream, then we send in a variable: key. Finally, we send http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iostream/manipulators/endl/[endl] down the stream. endl simply tells the console to go to the next line. </p>
<p>The 'key' variable represents the key that was pressed or released. More about this in a bit.</p>
<p>Let's give it a try. Launch your program and type some keys. I will type "qwerty". You should see something like this in the console:</p>

...................................</p>
<p>Don't worry about the crap at the beginning -- that's added by the debugger.</p>
<p>The fact that the 'key' is supplied as an 'int' may seem a bit strange. Perhaps you were expecting a string or a char? In fact, what this number represents is the http://www.asciitable.com/[ASCII code] for the key pressed. Check out this table:</p>
<p>image:images/ascii_table.jpg["ASCII Table"]</p>
<p>On the right of each column in red, you will see a key on your keyboard. Under the corresponding "Dec" (decimal=base 10) column, you will see the number that you will receive in the key functions. </p>
<h1>[TIP]</h1>
<p>You can actually use something called http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/typecasting/[type casting] to turn the int into a 'char', or letter. Simply put "(char)" before the "key" variable so that your cout statement looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">cout &lt;&lt; &quot;keyPressed &quot; &lt;&lt; (char)key &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<h1>More about type casting later in this chapter!</h1>
<p>Fantastic. But presumably we want to do more with the key presses than print to the console. Let's use the keys to move a ball around on the screen.</p>
<p>Start by adding two variables to your testApp and using them to draw a circle, just like we did in the Adding Movement section:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">#include &quot;testApp.h&quot;

int myCircleX;
int myCircleY;

void testApp::setup(){
    myCircleX = 300;
    myCircleY = 200;
}

void testApp::update(){

}

void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(myCircleX, myCircleY, 60);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the Adding Movement section, we used variables so that we could have the circle move by itself. The difference this time is that we want the ball to move in response to our keyboard input. This means that we need to modify the values of the variables depending on which keys are pressed rather than incrementing it automatically every frame. So it follows that we need to change the value of myCircleX and myCircleY in mousePressed() (or mouseReleased() -- it's up to you!) instead of update().</p>
<p>Let's use a typical computer game keyboard scheme: say we want the ball to move up when we press 'w', to the left when we press 'a', down when we press 's', and right when we press 'd'. We could start by looking up the ASCII values and finding that the values are 119, 97, 115, and 100, respectively. Next, we think about what "up", "down", "left" and "right" mean in terms of our variables: myCircleX and myCircleY. What we end up with is:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::keyPressed(int key){
    if(key==119) // 'w' key
    {
        myCircleY--;
    }
    if(key==97) // 'a' key
    {
        myCircleX--;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As we discovered, any time any key is pressed, the keyPressed() function is called. However, we want to be more selective than that. We want to be able to make certain things happen when the 'w' key is pressed, and other things happen when the 'a' key is pressed, etc. So, we need to add some http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson2.html[if statements]. When the keyPressed function is called, the first thing that happens is we test if 'key' is equal to 119. </p>
<p>Notice the double equals sign. This signifies that we are performing a comparison rather than an assignment. In other words, we don't want to assign the value 119 to the variable 'key', we want to test whether key is equal to 119. If this turns out to be true, than the code inside the curly brackets immediately following the if() is executed.</p>
<p>Your challenge is to complete the function to respond to the 's' and 'd' keys.</p>
<h1>[TIP]</h1>
<p>This also works!</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">if(key=='w')
{
    myCircleY--;
}
if(key=='a')
{
    myCircleX--;
}
</code></pre>

<p>=====================================================================</p>
<h2>Mighty Mouse</h2>
<p>Keyboard interaction is great, but what about the mouse? You might have noticed the following functions hanging out in testApp also:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::mouseMoved(int x, int y ){

}

void testApp::mouseDragged(int x, int y, int button){

}

void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){

}

void testApp::mouseReleased(int x, int y, int button){

}
</code></pre>

<p>Create a new project called MouseInteraction so we can play with them.</p>
<p>image:images/MouseInteraction01.png["Mouse Interaction Project"]</p>
<p>Let's do the same thing with the mouse functions that we did with the key functions. Add the following to your project:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::mouseMoved(int x, int y){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mouseMoved: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void testApp::mouseDragged(int x, int y, int button){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mouseDragged: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; &quot; button: &quot; &lt;&lt; button &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mousePressed: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; &quot; button: &quot; &lt;&lt; button &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void testApp::mouseReleased(int x, int y, int button){
     cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mouseReleased: &quot; &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; &quot; button: &quot; &lt;&lt; button &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The 'x' and 'y' variables in the cout statement represent the location of the mouse click -- very handy information to have.</p>
<p>Run the program and you should see something like this:</p>
<p>...................................
mouseMoved: 627, 500
mouseMoved: 619, 500
mouseMoved: 610, 500</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>mouseMoved: 426, 473
mouseMoved: 426, 476
mouseMoved: 427, 478
mousePressed: 426, 478 button: 0
mouseDragged: 427, 477 button: 0</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>mouseDragged: 548, 411 button: 0
mouseDragged: 547, 411 button: 0
mouseDragged: 546, 411 button: 0
mouseReleased: 546, 411 button: 0
mouseMoved: 544, 411
mouseMoved: 543, 411
mousePressed: 543, 411 button: 0
mouseDragged: 542, 411 button: 0</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>mouseDragged: 433, 396 button: 0
mouseDragged: 433, 377 button: 0
mouseReleased: 433, 377 button: 0
mouseMoved: 434, 370
mouseMoved: 433, 367
...................................</p>
<p>There are a few important things to notice about this output. First, you will probably see a ton of "mouseMoved" messages. Indeed, this function is called whenever the mouse is moved so much as a single pixel, so be aware of this when adding code to mouseMoved. Next, notice that you see a "mousePressed" before every "mouseDragged" event, and then a bunch of "mouseDragged" messages, and then "mouseReleased" before it switches back to "mouseMoved".</p>
<p>Interacting With Graphics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>So now we know how to make something happen when the user does any mouse business. But printing to the console is hardly the kind of interaction we want. When it comes to interacting with GUI applications, the mouse is used in a variety of ways: simple clicking, double-clicking, dragging, hovering, gestures, etc. One very basic interaction is "user clicks on something, something happens." Let's see how we might accomplish this.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that we wanted our trusty circle to expand whenever the user clicks on it. Let's start by setting up a new project called MouseInteraction2. It will start out very similar to our 'MouseInteraction' project:</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">int myCircleX=200;
int myCircleY=300;
int myCircleRadius=100;

void testApp::setup(){
}

void testApp::update(){
}

void testApp::draw(){
    ofSetColor(255, 0, 255);
    ofCircle(myCircleX, myCircleY, myCircleRadius);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we have added a new variable called 'myCircleRadius'. It should be clear that, if we want the circle to grow, all we have to do is increase myCircleRadius. The trick will be to determine when this should happen.</p>
<p>It's clear that it has something to do with the mousePressed function that we just discovered above. We know that mousePressed is called every time the user clicks the mouse, so if we simply drop 'myCircleRadius++;' into the mousePressed function, we would be half way there. Try this out.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){
    myCircleRadius++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You should find that the circle grows every time you click the mouse, regardless of whether or not your clicked inside the circle. But our challenge is to only grow the circle when the use clicks <em>inside</em> of it. So how might we go about this?</p>
<p>Well, luckily we are dealing with a circle, which will make it significantly easier. Because if we can determine the distance between the center of the circle and the location of the mouse click, we can compare this distance to the radius, and if it is less than the radius, then the click was inside the circle. Take a look at the diagrams:</p>
<p>image:images/hit-test-01.png["Hit Test 1"]</p>
<p>We know that the radius of the circle = 300, and we know that the mouse click is 230 pixels away from the center of the circle. So, was the mouse click inside the circle?</p>
<p>image:images/hit-test-02.png["Hit Test 2"]</p>
<p>In this case, we know that the mouse click was 90 pixels from the center of the circle, so the click was clearly inside the circle.</p>
<p>So how do we measure this distance? openFrameworks provides a function called 
ofDist([x1], [y1], [x2], [y2]) that will save us from doing any basic trigonometry. All we have to do is give it our two coordinates. </p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){
    float distance = ofDist(myCircleX, myCircleY, x, y);
    cout &lt;&lt; distance &lt;&lt; endl;

    myCircleRadius++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The 'cout' will allow us to check what kind of values we are getting from ofDist. Run your program now. Click around the screen and see what kind of values get printed in your console.</p>
<p>So the only thing left to do is compare 'myCircleRadius' to 'distance', and we can do this using a simple if statement.</p>
<pre><code class="cpp">void testApp::mousePressed(int x, int y, int button){

    if(distance &lt; myCircleRadius)
    {
        myCircleRadius++;
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code says "first calculate the distance btween the center of the circle and the mouse click. Then compare 'distance' to 'myCircleRadius'. If (and only if) distance is LESS THAN myCircleRadius, increment myCircleRadius by 1."</p>
<p>Et voila!  You are interacting with graphics!</p>
<h2>Technical Topics</h2>
<p>In the example above, we looked at one of the most basic control structures: the http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/lesson2.html[if statement]. Control structures like the if statement allow you to alter the flow of your program based on criteria that you define. Control structures are not an openFrameworks "thing", but rather a feature of the <code>c++</code> language. Let's take a moment to review a few basics of the <code>c++</code> language.</p>
<p>Variables</p>
<pre><code>
In the &quot;Adding Movement&quot; section, we introduced the idea of using variables to represent values that change over the course of your program. We used 2 integers, or *int*s - 'int myCircleX' and 'int myCircleY' - to represent the location of a circle. When you declare a variable as an 'int', you are telling the computer &quot;I only intend to put whole numbers into this variable.&quot;  This made sense in our example because we were moving a circle by a single pixel, so we didn't need to worry about fractions. 

But there will be times when you do need to have a variable that can hold a fraction, or something completely different, such as letters, words, even a location in memory. There are variable types for each of these situations. Here is a short list of some of them from http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/[cplusplus.com]

image:images/variable-types.png[&quot;Variable Types&quot;]

So, as you can see, our basic integer takes up 4 bytes in memory. This is a finite amount of memory, and therefore there is limited (but pretty huge!) range of values that it can hold: namely, -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If you need to store higher (or lower) numbers, you'd have to use a 'long int', which (contrary to the diagram) can go up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 and down to -9,223,372,036,854,775,808. 

It may be unintuitive to make such distinctions when dealing with variables. A number is a number, right? Why differentiate between a decimal number and a whole number? The reason has to do with how values are stored in your computer's memory. Ultimately, by giving the programmer the responsibility of declaring what range and precision their variables need, the program can run that much more efficiently.

=====================================================================

There is one important kind of variable that is not covered in this chart: 'string'. A string can hold a sequence of characters. ... more to come ...

Loops
~~~~~

Loops are perhaps one of the most important things to be comfortable with as a programmer. They are, arguably, the main advantage of using a computer: doing something over and over again very rapidly is the definition of what a computer is good at. There are a few different kinds of loops, and it is important to be familiar with all of them.

Suppose you want to a circle every 20 pixels across your window. One option would be to copy and paste ofCircle commands like this:

~~~~{.cpp}
void testApp::draw(){
    ofCircle(20, 300, 10);
    ofCircle(40, 300, 10);
    ofCircle(60, 300, 10);
    ofCircle(80, 300, 10);
    ofCircle(100, 300, 10);
    ofCircle(120, 300, 10);
    // repeat 
    ofCircle(1020, 300, 10);
}
~~~~

That would be over 50 lines of code - ugh. And what if you decided you wanted them every 30 pixels instead of every 20 pixels?  You'd have to go back and edit each line of code. And what if the size of your window changed?  This is clearly unacceptable. Consider this code:

~~~~{.cpp}
void testApp::draw(){
    int x = 10;

    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
    // copy and paste 47 more times
}
~~~~

In some ways, this is even worse. We've turned one line of code per circle into 2 lines of code per circle. However, there is one very important difference: in this case, the 2 lines are identical every time. We have &quot;abstracted&quot; the task -- that is, we have taken out the specifics and made it into a more general form. 

So now, all that's left to do is to tell the computer to do those 2 lines of code a bunch of times instead of us pasting it in ourselves. This is where loops come in.

do...while loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All loops basically take the same form:

. Set up some initial values (initialization)
. Execute the body of the loop 
. Decide whether to go back to step 2 or exit the loop

The simplest loop is the do/while loop. As the name suggests, this loop allows you to ask the computer to &quot;do&quot; something &quot;while&quot; a condition is met. Using a do/while loop, we can easily draw 51 circles

~~~~{.cpp}
void testApp::draw(){
    int i = 0;
    int x = 20;
    do {
        ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
        x+=20;
        i++;
    } while( i &lt; 51 );
}
~~~~

So what just happened?  Let's go through the code step by step as if we were the computer. I apologize that this is the most tedious thing you will ever read, but hopefully it will illustrate what is going on in the loop.

. Initialize a variable called i and set it equal to 0
. Initialize a variable called x and set it equal to 20
. Draw a circle at (20, 30) with a radius of 10
. Increment x by 20 (it now equals 40)
. Increment i by 1 (it now equals 1)
. Is 1 less than 51?  
.. Yes!  Go back to the beginning of the loop
. Draw a circle at (40, 30) with a radius of 10
. Increment x by 20 (it now equals 60)
. Increment i by 1 (it now equals 2)
. Is 2 less than 51?  
.. Yes!  Go back to the beginning of the loop
. Draw a circle at (60, 30) with a radius of 10
. Increment x by 20 (it now equals 80)
. Increment i by 1 (it now equals 3)
. Is 3 less than 51? 
.. Yes!  Go back to the beginning of the loop
. [REPEAT 46 TIMES UNTIL i=50 and x=1000]
. Draw a circle at (1000, 30) with a radius of 10
. Increment x by 20 (it now equals 1020)
. Increment i by 1 (it now equals 51)
. Is 51 less than 51? 
.. NO!  Exit out of loop and continue on to whatever comes next

[TIP]
=====================================================================
We could actually make this even a bit more efficient and make the 'x' variable to double duty like this:
~~~~{.cpp}
int x = 20;
do {
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x+=20;
} while(x &lt; ofGetWidth());
~~~~
This has the added advantage of being immune to changes in window size. Try making the window bigger and smaller -- the circles will always be drawn to the end of the window.
=====================================================================

while loop
^^^^^^^^^^

In a while loop, the 'while' part is simply moved up to the top of the loop. So if we want to draw a string of circles with a while loop, it would look like this:

~~~~{.cpp}
int i = 0;
int x = 20;
while(i &lt; 51)
{
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x+=20;
    i++;
}
~~~~

The only difference between a do...while loop and a while loop is that the the condition happens first, before the loop body runs. For example, suppose we edited our do...while loop like this:

~~~~{.cpp}
int x = 10;
do {
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
} while( x &lt; mouseX );
~~~~

Notice how we've changed the condition so that the circles will be drawn until 'x' is less than the x position of the mouse. Run this code and see what happens. Notice, in particular, that there is always 1 circle on the screen regardless of how far to the left the mouse goes. Now transform that into a while loop:

~~~~{.cpp}
int x = 10;
while( x &lt; mouseX )
{
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x += 20;
}
~~~~

Now, if you move your mouse beyond the left side of the window, nothing at all is drawn. This is because before the body of the loop is executed (namely the ofCircle draw command), the test is done. So if mouseX is less than x, no circles are drawn at all.

for loop
^^^^^^^^

We've saved the best for last. The for loop is probably the one that you will use the most. This might be because it combines all 3 parts of a loop (initialization, condition, and incrementing) into one compact syntax. Let's draw the same circles using a for loop:

~~~~{.cpp}
int x = 20;
for(int i=0; i&lt;51; i++)
{
    ofCircle(x, 300, 10);
    x+=20;
}
~~~~

The syntax of the for loop can be a little daunting at first, but let's take it apart piece by piece. The first part is initialization: &quot;int i=0;&quot;  Pretty straightforward: we now have an integer called i that we have set to 0. The next part is the condition: &quot;i&lt;51&quot;. In other words, we want the loop to continue so long as i is less than 51. And lastly,  the increment: &quot;i++&quot;. After every iteration of the loop, we will increment i by 1.

We saw each of these things in the other kind of loops. THe only difference here is that they are all smushed into one line. 

Arrays
~~~~~~

Another strength of computers is that they are encyclopedic: that is, they can keep track of a huge number of things at a time. Suppose we want to draw six thousand moving particles?  We know from the loop section that it is trivial to do something over and over again, but so far, we have only used loops to achieve a relatively consistent pattern. If we want do draw tons of particles, each with their own position, things get a little more complicated.

.50000 particles!

float circle1x;
float circle1y;
float circle1r;
float circle2x;
float circle2y;
float circle2r;
float circle3x;
float circle3y;
float circle3r;

void testApp::setup(){
    ofSetFrameRate(24);

    circle1x = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circle1y = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circle1r = ofRandom(10, 40);

    circle2x = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circle2y = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circle2r = ofRandom(10, 40);

    circle3x = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circle3y = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circle3r = ofRandom(10, 40);

}

void testApp::update(){
    circle1x += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circle1y += ofRandom(-1,1);

    circle2x += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circle2y += ofRandom(-1,1);

    circle3x += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circle3y += ofRandom(-1,1);
}

void testApp::draw(){
    ofCircle(circle1x, circle1y, circle1r);

    ofCircle(circle2x, circle2y, circle2r);

    ofCircle(circle3x, circle3y, circle3r);
}
~~~~

TIP: Notice the use of ofRandom(). This function will return a random number. It takes 2 arguments: the minimum possible value and the maximum possible value. What I am saying in this code is &quot;give me a number between 0 and the width of the screen.&quot;

Technically this works, but we have only drawn 3 circles, and already the code is getting unwieldy. We want to draw 1000! We clearly have a bunch of variables that are used in very similar ways. Why not group, say, all of the x coordinates into a single set, and all of the y coordinates, etc.?  

These sets are called arrays. Check out the following code:

~~~~{.cpp}
float circleX[3];
float circleY[3];
float circleRad[3];

void testApp::setup(){
    ofSetFrameRate(24);

    circleX[0] = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circleY[0] = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circleRad[0] = ofRandom(10, 40); 

    circleX[1] = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circleY[1] = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circleRad[1] = ofRandom(10, 40); 

    circleX[2] = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
    circleY[2] = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
    circleRad[2] = ofRandom(10, 40); 
}

void testApp::update(){

    circleX[0] += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circleY[0] += ofRandom(-1,1);

    circleX[1] += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circleY[1] += ofRandom(-1,1);

    circleX[2] += ofRandom(-1,1);
    circleY[2] += ofRandom(-1,1);
}

void testApp::draw(){

    ofCircle(circleX[0], circleY[0], circleRad[0]);
    ofCircle(circleX[1], circleY[1], circleRad[1]);
    ofCircle(circleX[2], circleY[2], circleRad[2]);
}
~~~~

As you can see, we've replaced int circle1x, int circle2x, and int circle3x with simply int circleX[3]. Now circleX is an &quot;array&quot; that can hold up to 3 integers, rather than just 1. Read a little further, and you will see that, in order to assign a value to one of the ints in the array, you use the square brackets, like this: circleX[0] = 50;  

Down in the draw function, you can see that we use the same syntax to use the values that we have previously assigned to a particular slot in the array.

But this is still kind of a mess. One sign that you might not be utilizing loops as much as possible is if you see patterns in your code -- that is, similar sequences of code over and over again. So let's try to clean this up even more using some 'for' loops. 

~~~~{.cpp}
float circleX[3];
float circleY[3];
float circleRad[3];

void testApp::setup(){
    ofSetFrameRate(24);

    for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
    {
        circleX[i] = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
        circleY[i] = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
        circleRad[i] = ofRandom(10, 40); 
    }
}

void testApp::update(){

    for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
    {
        circleX[i] += ofRandom(-1,1);
        circleY[i] += ofRandom(-1,1);
    }
}

void testApp::draw(){

    for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
    {
        ofCircle(circleX[i], circleY[i], circleRad[i]);
    }
}
~~~~

Now, instead of putting hard-coded numbers between the square brackets, we use the 'i' variable of our for loop.

#define
^^^^^^^

A wise person once said: the primary virtue of a programer is laziness. Suppose you wanted to change the number of circles that appear on the screen from 3 to 500. Obviously, the first step would be to change circleX[3] to circleX[500], and likewise circleY and circleRad. Oh, but that's not all. You'd still have to go through every &quot;for&quot; loop and change i&lt;3 to i&lt;50. That's a lot of work!  

It would be great if we could use a variable to keep track of how many items we have in our array! It might look something like this:

~~~~{.cpp}
int num = 500;
float circleX[num];
float circleY[num];
float circleRad[num];
~~~~

Unfortunately, this isn't possible. You can't use a variable to declare a variable. 

Instead, we will use a new thing called a #define (pronounced: &quot;pound define&quot;). Take a look at this:

~~~~{.cpp}
#define NUM_CIRCLES 500

float circleX[NUM_CIRCLES];
float circleY[NUM_CIRCLES];
float circleRad[NUM_CIRCLES];
int circleR[NUM_CIRCLES];
int circleG[NUM_CIRCLES];
int circleB[NUM_CIRCLES];

void testApp::setup(){
    ofSetFrameRate(24);

    for(int i=0; i&lt;NUM_CIRCLES; i++)
    {
        circleX[i] = ofRandom(0, ofGetWidth());
        circleY[i] = ofRandom(0, ofGetHeight());
        circleRad[i] = ofRandom(10, 40); 

        circleR[i] = ofRandom(0, 255);
        circleG[i] = ofRandom(0, 255);
        circleB[i] = ofRandom(0, 255);
    }
}

void testApp::update(){

    for(int i=0; i&lt;NUM_CIRCLES; i++)
    {
        circleX[i] += ofRandom(-1,1);
        circleY[i] += ofRandom(-1,1);
    }
}

void testApp::draw(){

    for(int i=0; i&lt;NUM_CIRCLES; i++)
    {
        ofSetColor(circleR[i], circleG[i], circleB[i]);
        ofCircle(circleX[i], circleY[i], circleRad[i]);
    }
}
~~~~

At the very top, notice the line &quot;#define NUM_CIRCLES 500&quot;. This isn't technically a line of `c++` code, but rather a message to your compiler. It tells the compiler &quot;before you start compiling code, anywhere you see NUM_CIRCLES, replace it with 500&quot;. That's it! A #define is one of a couple messages that you can send to the compiler (or, more accurately, the preprocessor), known more broadly as http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/[preprocessor directives]. We will talk more about them at a later date., but for now, all you need to know is that #define is a very simple find/replace procedure.
